      <h2 class="card-title">The Best Ice Cream Recipe</h2>
      <span class="card-description subtle">This silky, luscious and very classic custard can be used as the base for any ice cream flavor you can dream up. These particular proportions of milk and cream to egg yolk will give you a thick but not sticky ice cream that feels decadent but not heavy. The best thing about this ice cream though, is that it's purely guilt-free! It's made with coconut sugar and organic milk creating a creamy treat with high quality nutrients!</span>

  <h3>INGREDIENTS:</h3>
  <p><strong>YIELD:</strong> 1 quart</p>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
    <br>
    <li>1 cup coconut sugar</li>
    <br>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <br>
    <li>6 egg yolks</li>
    <br>
    <li>3/8 tsp xantham gum</li>

<div class="instructions">
  <h3>INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
    <h4>STEP 1</h4>
    <p>In a small pot, simmer whole milk, sugar and salt until sugar completely dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat. In a separate bowl, whisk yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the hot milk solution into the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back into the pot with the milk. Return pot to medium-low heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Whisk constantly.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>STEP 2</h4>
    <p>Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. Flavor you ice cream,and churn in your ice cream machine. Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until needed.</p>

    <h4>TIPS</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><em>This recipe for ice cream base may be churned on its own, but it is meant to have flavors added.</em></li>
    <br>
    <li><em>For better results for vanilla ice cream use vanilla beans since the flavor of coconut sugar may overpower vanilla extract</em></li></ul>
